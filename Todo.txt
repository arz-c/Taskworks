- Order lists automatically by 1. priority 2. due date
- Add checkmark to task for when a task is finished
- Make tasks reset their checkmark every day
- Add an "Active" option to task editor for when the user doesn't want tasks to repeat everyday (based on DOTW settings)
- Make due text change colour when date is approaching

==== Done ====
- Have colours associated with labels
    - Change label background colour to associated colour
- Add "Create task" and "Create list" buttons
- Reset task editor after hitting save/cancel
- Fix task editor CSS
- Make UI for label editing
- Make tasks and lists editable
- Clean up code (maybe move addTextToParent under Form?)
- Remove list label commented code

==== Future Improvements ====
- When task editor is open, save the labels that are checked so that if a new label is created and the label inputs are erased and updated, the ones that were checked remain checked

- Make tasks and lists moveable (reorderable)
