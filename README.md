# Taskworks, a Scheduling App
Taskworks is a scheduling app I created because I wanted a highly personalized scheduler that would work well for me. A lot of the app is inspired by trello.com, a website I used for ~3 years.

# Features
## List View
- Create tasks to represent things you want to do
- Set the task's start date, end date, due date, days of the week you want to work (no weekends?), etc.
- Create lists to group tasks
- Tasks in lists are ordered by 1. priority (a property which you set) and 2. due date
- Assign labels to tasks to further organize them
- Check off tasks when they're completed

## Calendar View
- See a month view with a list of tasks to be worked on for each day
- Tasks in each day are again ordered by 1. priority and 2. due date
- Check off a daily instance of a task when it's been complete

## Accounts
- The app is account-based and stores data in a .json file
- Passwords are hashed
- Sessions keep user logged in
